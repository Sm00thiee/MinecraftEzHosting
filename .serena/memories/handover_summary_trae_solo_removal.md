The user asked me to clean the project from "Trae" and "Solo" mentions.
I have:

- removed `vite-plugin-trae-solo-badge` from `vite.config.ts`
- removed the dependency `vite-plugin-trae-solo-badge`
- changed the title in `index.html`
- I also tried to run the linter, but it failed due to pre-existing issues. I updated the lint script in `package.json` to point to the correct config file, but there are still many linting errors. I did not fix them as it was not part of the original request.
