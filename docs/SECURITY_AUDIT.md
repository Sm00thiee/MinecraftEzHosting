# Security Audit Report - Credential Exposure

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

## Executive Summary

A critical security vulnerability was discovered where production credentials were committed to the repository in the `.env` file. All exposed credentials must be considered compromised and require immediate rotation.

## Exposed Credentials (ROTATE IMMEDIATELY)

### 1. Supabase Credentials

- **SUPABASE_URL:** `https://dxjhobixyehkcgogezue.supabase.co`
- **SUPABASE_ANON_KEY:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImR4amhvYml4eWVoa2Nnb2dlenVlIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTc5NjE2NjYsImV4cCI6MjA3MzUzNzY2Nn0.dPSYdoVAIOMsxUnsxDUQs9PYKThowmTwe2zDjTfeKoE`
- **SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImR4amhvYml4eWVoa2Nnb2dlenVlIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1Nzk2MTY2NiwiZXhwIjoyMDczNTM3NjY2fQ.7RM8fPgi6ceJjQVm4tAch1bG_s8pijH66BfNWKWOU7Q`
- **DATABASE_URL:** Contains database password for `db.dxjhobixyehkcgogezue.supabase.co`

### 2. Application Secrets

- **JWT_SECRET:** Default placeholder value (needs proper secret)
- **ADMIN_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN:** Default placeholder value (needs rotation)

## Impact Assessment

### High Risk

- **Database Access:** Full read/write access to production database
- **Authentication Bypass:** Service role key allows admin-level operations
- **Data Breach:** Potential access to all user data and server configurations
- **Service Disruption:** Malicious actors could modify or delete critical data

### Medium Risk

- **JWT Token Forgery:** Weak JWT secret could allow session hijacking
- **Admin Account Compromise:** Bootstrap token could create unauthorized admin access

## Immediate Actions Taken

✅ **Completed:**

1. Added `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits
2. Replaced all real credentials with placeholder values in `.env`
3. Created this security audit document

## Required Actions (URGENT)

### 1. Supabase Security (Priority 1)

- [ ] Rotate Supabase anon key immediately
- [ ] Rotate Supabase service role key immediately
- [ ] Change database password
- [ ] Review Supabase access logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Update RLS policies if needed

### 2. Application Security (Priority 2)

- [ ] Generate new JWT secret (minimum 32 characters, cryptographically secure)
- [ ] Generate new admin bootstrap token
- [ ] Invalidate all existing user sessions
- [ ] Review application logs for unauthorized access

### 3. Infrastructure Security (Priority 3)

- [ ] Audit all deployment environments for credential usage
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines with new credentials
- [ ] Review Docker configurations for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Update production environment variables

## Git History Concerns

⚠️ **CRITICAL:** The exposed credentials are permanently stored in Git history. Consider:

1. **Repository History Cleanup:**
   - Use `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to remove sensitive data
   - Force push to rewrite history (coordinate with all team members)
   - Alternative: Create new repository and migrate clean codebase

2. **Access Control:**
   - Review who has access to the repository
   - Audit clone/fork permissions
   - Monitor for unauthorized repository access

## Prevention Measures Implemented

- [x] Environment file protection in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks for credential detection
- [ ] Security validation scripts
- [ ] Developer security training documentation

## Monitoring and Detection

- [ ] Set up alerts for Supabase unusual access patterns
- [ ] Monitor application logs for authentication anomalies
- [ ] Implement credential scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled

## Contact Information

**Security Team:** [Add contact information]  
**Incident Response:** [Add emergency contact]  
**Supabase Support:** [Add support contact if needed]
